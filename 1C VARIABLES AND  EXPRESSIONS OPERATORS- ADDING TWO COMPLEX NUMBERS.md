# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - find Compound interest

## AIM
To write a Python program for find Compound interest, and get the user input using the `eval()` function.

## ALGORITHM
1. Begin the program.
2. Use the `eval()` function to get input from the user.
3. Enter the formula to find Compound interest.
4. Print the Compound interest.
5. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
# Reg.No-212223060188
#Name-K.nithiyasree
#Write your code here
```
p = float(input())

t = float(input())

r = float(input())

ci =  p * (pow((1 + r / 100), t)) 

print("Compound interest : {:.2f}".format(ci))
```
